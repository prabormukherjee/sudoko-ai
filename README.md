# sudoku-ai

A simple sudoku solving game using python. The sudoku is in the first cell named `Grid`. You can change the initial sudoku to get answer for yours. Cell 8 and 9 is not related to the game solving, it is just to show to the `deepcopy` and `backtracking` and `recursion` works.    
The source code in python is available in the notebook file. I also add one image of the game that helps you to understand the process, how to solve it manually.
